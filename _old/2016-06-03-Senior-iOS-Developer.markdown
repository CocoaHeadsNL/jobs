# Company

Capture International B.V. is an ambitious funded startup from Amsterdam that is developing a unique location-based camera sharing app for iOS and Android. There is a working beta for iOS that takes photos, shares them with friends and other users nearby and stores everything in a cloud album. The exiting moment has arrived to build the first live version for the App Store. _Android developers should know that we will start building for Google Play very soon._

As a Mobile Developer, you will have the opportunity to work on a highly visible, exciting and cool end-user product that is built for the masses. You will bring fresh ideas and learn in all areas, including location tacking, photo editing, user interaction, battery management, data science and much more. You will work in a small agile team of experts that consists of a Product Manager/UX designer, Backend Developer, Android developer and a Tester.

# You

We are looking for a skilled iOS Developer that can build high performance iOS apps. You are fluent in Objective-C, Swift and know everything UIKit has to offer. We appreciate if you have launched an app into the AppStore before.

You like building custom elements, have a sharp eye for detail and have no problem to interpret a good UI design into a well-aligned and scalable implementation. You apply best practices to ensure a secure system.

Additional experience in mobile, frontend, backend or web-development experience is highly desirable (e.g. Java, Android, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Django, Go, etc.).

# Offer

A fun and dynamic working environment with a ping pong table and a piano. Youâ€™ll get the opportunity to focus on a recognizable end user product, with plenty of room for creative input and ownership.

The possibility to grow (Tech Lead, Architect, Co-owner) with a company and product from the start, including a competitive salary and share options.

Capture International is based in a spacious and living room like office near Amsterdam Amstel. For city lovers there will be a possibility to work on the Keizersgracht as well.

# Apply

You can send us your CV or give us a call. We are always interested to hear about your role in projects you are proud of. We also like to hear about any IT or GitHub projects you did outside of work.

Dont forget to mention Cocoaheads :)
