**iOS Engineer**

At [Awkward](http://www.madeawkward.com) we like to think we’re building products that solve a problem. Every project has its technical difficulties, our goal is to not only create something with a beautiful user experience but something that’s also beautiful from a technical point of view. We do this by iterating quickly and get a functional build up and running as soon as we can.  

Building great products isn’t as simple as knowing a certain programming language extremely well. Our engineers are product-aware, pretty much pixel perfect and passionate about user experience. We’re looking for someone that isn’t afraid to get their hands dirty with other technical product related tasks like wrangling with front-end and back-end code and likes to dabble in weird, new, old and/or obscure code.  

**What you will be doing**

- Ship awesome apps
- Apply new ideas quickly
- Maintain code quality
- Create and contribute to open source projects  

**What we expect from you**  

- You’ve shipped one or more Objective-C iOS apps, ideally available in the app store
- Kick-ass personal (open-source) projects and experimentations
- You’re up-to-date with the latest iOS innovations (Swift)
- You’re product minded and able to make UX/UI decisions
- Outstanding written and verbal communication skills, proficiency in Dutch is not a requirement

**Working at Awkward**  

We’re a slightly Awkward bunch of people passionate about building great products and services. Working at Awkward is more than working from 9 to 5, building things is something that’s almost instinctive. We believe the right work/life balance is key to doing great work.  

Awkward is located in the industrial harbours of Rotterdam, The Netherlands, surrounded by ships and other creative companies.  

Our spacious office features 5 meter high ceilings, huge windows providing a ton of natural light and a fully equipped kitchen. We often cook meals for the whole team and barbecue as much as the unpredictable weather allows it.  

One of the first things you’ll learn is how to operate the espresso machine. Our coffee beans are freshly roasted at our neighbour Santas and our bread comes from Jordy’s Bakery, both are right below us. The only thing that smells better than the freshly baked bread is our homemade apple pie. We like apple pie.  

**Perks**

- Competitive salaries
- The hardware and software you need
- Paid time off
- Space for side projects and relaxation
- Breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks
