# CODING CHAMPION at THE MOBILE COMPANY

From our beautiful office in the heart of Amsterdam, we create the best mobile apps possible. We make them smart, we make them pretty, but what we value most is that those little icons on your device make your day-to-day life a lot easier. We have what it takes. Currently we work with ABN Amro, ANWB, BVA Auctions, De Telegraaf, OHRA and XS4ALL, amongst several others.
We are writing the future. We are the mobile company. Mobile is our middle name.

# Your role

We are looking forward to welcome an experienced, full-time (40h) mobile iOS developer. You are part of a professional development team. You develop mobile applications within an Agile Scrum-environment. You are (partially) responsible for the look-and-feel and interaction of perfectly functional applications. You make the best judgments on performance and technical implementation of the interaction interface related to budget and costs.

# What we expect

Being a gadget freak with a strong focus on usability would be a nice quality. Act and think on Bachelor level with a background in computer science. Demonstrated knowledge of techniques and programming languages (Objective-C, Swift, SQL). Scrum and Agile team knowledge and practice. Show initiative, be flexible and take responsibility. Work independently and cooperate in a team. Good communication in English, oral and written. Analytical, accurate, innovative and client oriented. Ambitious, enthusiastic and result driven.

# What we offer

We’ll give you autonomy in your job, so you can be your most creative and efficient self. There’s a spot for you here in our great office in the heart of Amsterdam, where we maintain flexible working hours. To keep your energy levels up, we provide freshly ground coffee and stimulating teas, biological fruit and an excellent lunch (and to keep our spirits up, we like to raise the glass frequently). And now for the money: we offer a competitive salary and an interesting profit share.
