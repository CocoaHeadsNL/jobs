# iOS Software Engineer

We are looking for smart and passionate mobile developers with a keen eye for design. Join our team and help us create great apps for great clients like PON, ING and Weeronline.

### FULL-TIME · UTRECHT

## Who are we looking for?

This job is ideal for someone who gets his energy from developing elegant, simple and smart mobile software that people love to use. At Touchwonders this is what we call: apps that make you smile :)

To achieve this we are looking for very bright people with high technical expertise but also with a great interest in design. Because in the best apps, design is not only the responsibility of the designer. As an iOS developer you too play a crucial role in how the app behaves and feels like.

## How we work

Our engineers work in teams of passionate developers and designers who all have the same drive as you: improve people’s lives by making simple, smart and beautiful apps that make people smile.

We have developed our own approach to get from a client's first idea to an app. “Agile development” plays an important role in this. We iterate a lot and include our clients very closely in this process.

In this process we iterate on the smallest details. All the while the designers and developers continuously consult each other as much as possible. Everybody is stimulated to think about how our products can be improved.

Meanwhile, our Jenkins-based CI setup allows us to move fast and "ship" daily.

## What we offer you
