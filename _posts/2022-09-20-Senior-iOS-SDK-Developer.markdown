*AMSTERDAM · REMOTE*

# The Opportunity

For our [Chat SDK](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift) team we are seeking a Senior iOS SDK Developer to work on our native iOS SDK libraries. This role is 100% remote, preferably in Europe.

# What you will be doing

As an iOS SDK Developer, you strive to simplify how applications are built. You will lead by example, raise the team’s technological proficiency, and influence the rest of the team towards best practices and mature technological choices.

You will write and maintain our open-source SDKs that are used by hundreds of our customers and consumed by hundreds of millions of their users.

Most of your day will be dedicated to software design, research, and coding. You will work with modern iOS technologies, such as Swift, SwiftUI, and Combine, with a heavy focus on code quality, API design, testing, and CI/CD processes.

# You have

- Passion for writing simple and testable code, and for designing APIs meant to be used by other developers
- Deep knowledge of UIKit, experience with SwiftUI, modular UI elements, and design systems
- Proficiency in Swift and the iOS development ecosystem
- An enthusiasm for all kinds of iOS testing: unit, integration, UI, snapshot tests

# Bonus points

- Knowledge of CoreData
- Experience with developing SDK libraries or maintaining open-source projects
- Familiarity with reactive patterns, experience with RxSwift or Combine
- Experience with Fastlane and CI/CD best practices

The opportunity of true ownership and accountability has a massive impact on your career. These are the things you can rarely experience in huge corporations.
