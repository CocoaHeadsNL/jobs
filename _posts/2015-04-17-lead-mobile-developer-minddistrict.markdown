#Minddistrict Lead Mobile Developer

Minddistrict is hiring a senior iOS and/or Android developer to lead our mobile development team.

#What is Minddistrict?

Minddistrict is the market leader in mental ehealth software in the Netherlands, with a 7 year history of constant growth. We currently provide software-as-a-service in the Netherlands, the UK and Germany. Our customers are health organizations whose staff use our software to communicate with their patients. Minddistrict operates from Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Berlin and London. 

#Who are the developers?

We are a small team (eight programmers, of which two are mobile developers, and three designers). We build the entire Minddistrict platform, from the mobile applications (iOS and Android) back to the server API and web application (Python/JavaScript). All development occurs in-house, and the development team drives the entire process, from the design stage through coding, to finally delivering and supporting our products. Our major focuses are product quality, user experience, customer security and privacy.
We care about code quality, and spend a significant amount of our time in code review, automation, and testing. We cultivate an atmosphere of constructive discussion: when we disagree about something we work hard to talk it out and find a solution everyone is satisfied with. A senior position in our team means you take an active role in these discussions, but not that you have to have all the answers.
We love Open Source software and you can find our contributions on our github company page. We are the main maintainers of the Python web development framework Grok.
Our team is mainly distributed between the Amsterdam and Rotterdam offices, and also has remote members in Greece and Colombia. While we are not hiring remote for this position, day-to-day work in our team allows a lot of flexibility as regards when and where you put your hours in: working from home some days every week, or for instance a few days from Sweden to extend a family holiday, are not a problem.

#The Minddistrict mobile applications

The Minddistrict iOS and Android v2 applications are available in the app stores, and we are working on v3. These free applications allow users to fill in structured diary entries, with the format chosen by their therapist, to give both them and their therapist insight into the day-to-day progress of their treatment. This video introduces the app (in Dutch).
Upcoming challenges for these applications are: a flexible charting engine for giving app users insight into the day-to-day behaviour they have recorded in their diaries; and messaging and video so that an app user can communicate directly with their therapist. With version 3 of the iOS application we will introduce Swift -- incrementally, but how fast depends partly on you!
As lead developer, your role includes guiding the mobile team’s direction and decisions of tooling and process. We currently use: Xcode, AppCode and Android Studio for coding; git, git flow and github for source control and code reviews; Gradle, xcodebuild, XCTest, JUnit, Robolectric, Mockito, Appium and Jenkins for building and testing; Transifex for i18n; Hockeyapp for crashes and internal build distribution. Jira is our central place for collaboration, ticketing, roadmaps, backlog and releases.
