===================================

Egeniq is growing steadily and we’re ready to add a person to our development team for a new department that provides secondment services to our customers. We are currently looking for an iOS (and of course, watchOS & tvOS) developer. More than skills or experience, we value passion for technology and in this case iOS in particular. You should be able to explain why you love programming and/or iOS, why you do what you do and how you think this could help us in our iOS projects.

This is a secondment job, which means that you get to work on big software projects while being on-site at our client’s office.

You will have a personal mentor assigned to you which will help you along the way and will serve as your coach during the secondment process.

### What we can offer you:

* We do awesome things. If you know us, you may already know this.
* We have been building apps for over half a decade, and our team is still learning every single day. We aim to constantly improve our processes and techniques and want you to take part in shaping Egeniq’s future.
* We treat developers well. Our management has a technical background. We know what works and what doesn’t.
* We value knowledge, and will help you gain more of it.
* The Gadget Kit: We’ll supply you with a MacBook Pro and all the devices you need for development.
* Mentor program to help you get started
* Company car is negotiable
* Possibility to attend certain conferences
* A competitive salary

### What we expect from you:

* You master at least one programming language.
* You have completed a computer science or other relevant study.
