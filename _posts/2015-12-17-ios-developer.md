WE ARE LOOKING FOR AN iOS DEVELOPER
===================================

Egeniq is growing steadily and we are ready to add another person to our development team. We are currently looking for an iOS (and, with it of course, watchOS & tvOS) developer. More than skills or experience, we value passion for technology and in this case iOS in particular. You should be able to explain why you love programming and/or iOS, why you do what you do and how you think this could help us in our iOS projects.

### Who we are looking for:

* You are not just a programmer, you are a software engineer – and you understand why this makes a difference.
* You have learned something you did not know before in the past 7 days.
* You often share your knowledge with others in one way or another.
* When you build something awesome, you take pride in your work.
* You have an urge to create things, tinker with stuff, or to write useful software.

### What we can offer you:

* We do awesome things.
* We are a young company, still very small but ambitious. Be part of the start of something great and help shape our future.
* We treat developers well. Our management has a technical background. We know what works and what does not.
* We value knowledge, and will help you gain more of it.
* The Gadget Kit: We will supply you with a MacBook Pro, a Thunderbolt Display and all the devices you need for development.

### What we expect from you:

* You master at least one programming language.
* You have completed a computer science or other relevant study.
* You are a sponge. You absorb knowledge. Knowledge is an energy source to you.
* You have a passion for programming.
* You are talented, and able to demonstrate that.

We love to share knowledge by the way, which is why we speak at conferences and organize mdevcon, a conference by and for mobile developers. As a token of appreciation, if you apply for this job and get past the initial interview (we do at least two before we hire someone), we will give you a ticket (as long as they are still available, so do not wait too long).

### Working for EGENIQ

Egeniq is completely designed as a virtual organisation. Our development environment, project management system, knowledge base, CRM system, accounting system and calendars are all available online. This means everybody can work from anywhere, as long as they are connected: our meetings are usually online.
Of course we recognize that sometimes it’s fruitful to work on something together in the same location and to share knowledge. We do this in our office or a suitable central location, or at our client’s offices. The key is that we do it when it makes sense, instead of making it the default. We strive to create the ideal mix of working remotely and working on site.

DO YOU RECOGNIZE YOURSELF IN THIS POSITION?
