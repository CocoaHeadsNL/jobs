WE ARE LOOKING FOR AN iOS DEVELOPER
===================================

Egeniq is growing steadily and we are ready to add another person to our development team. We are currently looking for an iOS (and, with it of course, watchOS & tvOS) developer. More than skills or experience, we value passion for technology and in this case iOS in particular. You should be able to explain why you love programming and/or iOS, why you do what you do and how you think this could help us in our iOS projects.

Please note that we are a remote team, which means you will be working from home. Our team is distributed across the globe.

[We are also looking for a iOS developers who prefer a secondment position.](http://jobs.cocoaheads.nl/job/posting/2016/11/17/ios-developer.html)

### Who we are looking for:

* You’re not just a programmer, you are a software engineer – and you understand why this makes a difference.
* You’ve learned something you didn’t know before in the past 7 days.
* You often share your knowledge with others in one way or another.
* When you build something awesome, you take pride in your work.
* You have an urge to create things, tinker with stuff, or to write useful software.

### What we can offer you:

* We do awesome things. If you know us, you may already know this.
* We have been building apps for over half a decade, and our team is still learning every single day. We aim to constantly improve our processes and techniques and want you to take part in shaping Egeniq’s future.
* We treat developers well. Our management has a technical background. We know what works and what doesn’t.
* We value knowledge, and will help you gain more of it.
* The Gadget Kit: We’ll supply you with a MacBook Pro, a Thunderbolt Display and all the devices you need for development.

### What we expect from you:

* You master at least one programming language.
* You have completed a computer science or other relevant study.
* You are a sponge. You absorb knowledge. Knowledge is an energy source to you.
* You have a passion for programming.
* You are talented, and able to demonstrate that.
