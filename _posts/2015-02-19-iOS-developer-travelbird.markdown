Are you a passionate iOS Developer who honoured a lot of developing skills in the last years? Do you want to use that knowledge to create a fully native iOS app for thousands of users? Or always wanted to play around with the newest features like iBeacons? Then you might just be the right person we're looking for! TravelBird is looking for new talent to join our production development team. Together we will create great new features and deliver an outstanding user experience to all our users.

#Become part of our team
At TravelBird we believe that every day presents a new chance to grow. We challenge our people in a focussed, creative and pleasant environment. TravelBird believes in a positive and responsible way of working, whereby we strive to improve everyday. Our aim is to bring back the joy to travel. This is clearly reflected in our open, social and entrepreneurial environment. Here, we learn from each other and value trust more than focussing on hierarchy. We create joy for the customers and a joy for employees. It’s not just a job. It’s a working experience you will love to wake up for every day.

#Your Challenge
To keep our team updated we will start with a "stand-up". This not only improves communications but also simplifies your work and planning. You will be part of an agile workflow and provide estimates on release cycles. During the day you will work with the team and CTO to realize those great features in the app. All those features sometimes come with a brand new design for the frontend. Therefore we want our developers to partner with our designers and help them define the wireframes. As a developer you play a crucial role in how the app looks and feels like. New features mostly mean new data. So designers aren’t your only friends in the company. You will maintain a close relation with our backend engineers and help them provide you the information you need.
We are highly committed on responsibility and believe the developer should really own the product. This comes with a lot of freedom within the company. Feel free to speak your mind about the app, it's features or possible improvements and which direction we should take.
