# Swift/Objective-C Developer (client editor team) - albelli

Looking for a challenging job as a Software Engineer? And are you eager to design and program new features for our internationally released Mac Photo Book program? Then come join our ambitious and enthusiastic team and apply now.

## Organization
Join one of the fastest growing companies in Amsterdam and work together with an international team, passionate about inspiring people to relive and share life’s moments through personalised photo products. With customer centricity at our core, we are driven by quality, creativity, innovation, development and providing the best customer experience anytime, anywhere.

We are albelli, specialists in photo products and experts in building intuitive software to create them. albelli is the consumer brand of Albumprinter, which was launched in 2003. We started selling photo books in the Netherlands and soon expanded into other markets and broadened our portfolio, to include other products like wall art and calendars.
Our head office is based in the center of Amsterdam. Our production facility in The Hague is where we produce all photo products for the European market: The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Sweden, Norway and UK. At the end of 2011 Albumprinter became part of Cimpress N.V. (NASDAQ:CMPR), previously Vistaprint, an international market leader in mass customisation.

## The department

As being part of the Mac editor development team at Albelli you are part of a relatively small but important team. This team is responsible for delivering high quality software serving our customers to be able to create excellent photobook products.
In this role you will join a development team working closely together with the Product owner, Scrum master and two Quality Engineers who also work in the Windows editor team. The Mac and Windows editor teams also collaborate to align features we offer to our customers.

Both teams work according to the Scrum/Agile framework.
For this department, we are currently looking for a macOS Developer (client editor team)

## Purpose of the role

As a software engineer you design and program new features for our internationally released Mac photo book program. Also, you help improving the program in several ways, such as adapting the program to changes in macOS, improving its performance and user experience, and bug fixing. 

## Responsibilities

Based on functional requirements, you design software solutions that fit seamlessly in Apple's Cocoa architecture and the Albumprinter code base. You program these solutions in Swift, or occasionally in Objective-C. You document the interface and the implementation details, write unit tests, and debug your code.

As Apple continuously improves the macOS environment, you are involved in maintaining the application, and making sure it runs on all supported macOS versions. A substantial part of the existing code base is written in Objective-C.

On occasion, you may be involved in 3rd line support. If a user encounters a problem that Albelli's 1st and 2nd line support departments cannot solve, your task is to examine the problem and provide a temporary or permanent solution. 

## Requirements
- Minimum of 3 years related work experience;
- Skilled developer for Swift and Objective-C with Cocoa in macOS;
- Ability to work independently, yet with an open mind for discussing different software solutions;
- Enthusiasm for the Mac platform, and a passion for making great software;
- Working knowledge of development tools: Xcode, LLDB debugger, and Apple's "instruments" suite;
- Familiar with version control (preferably git);
- Familiar with the basics of Unix;
- Familiar with at least two core technologies, such as Core Imaging, Core Animation, Core Data,  Autolayout, GCD, KVC/KVO;
- Familiar with agile/scrum working processes preferred;
- Use the English language in meetings and (technical) discussions
- Able to write technical documentation and programming comments in English;

## Offer
This high-impact role is challenging, as we have high expectations, but at the same time rewarding. We provide a highly competitive compensation package including perks, and an atmosphere with a lot of opportunities to develop yourself. You will work in an international environment with more than 33 different nationalities. albelli is located in the exciting heart of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The office is just a 2-minute walk from Amsterdam Central Station.

At albelli we work hard, have fun and never forget to celebrate our successes. We value innovation, creating high-quality products and delivering the best customer experience and service. We are a fast-growing company that combines an eCommerce mind-set with a tangible and emotional product. Besides our famous annual New Year's party and summer party, we end the week with Friday afternoon drinks.

Would you like to be part of this dynamic and international team? Would you like to work with award winning brands and products? Come join us and let’s create memorable moments together!
