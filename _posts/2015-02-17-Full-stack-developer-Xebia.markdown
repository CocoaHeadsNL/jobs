Do you want to be part of a team consisting out of the finest and most innovative Full Stack Developers there can be? Are you ready for Software Development done right?!
 
 
# We are cutting edge technology

True Software Craftsmen look for simplicity, and break down complex problems into managable chunks that can be solved with simple code. By focusing on quality, feedback and client value, we create great Software Systems and Mobile Applications. For instance we make apps for a broad range of clients and end users such as ING and NS.
 
Fast paced technology innovations are changing the game. Big Data is changing the way we look at data and client interaction. Development of modern web applications in HTML5, Angular-JS and Scala/Akka has changed drastically over the last years. Strategies like micro-services make us rewrite code more often, and for the best. Even the basics like version control and application deployment drastically evolved. We surf the front wave of these innovations and make them work in todays complex organizations.
 
At Xebia we gather very exceptional people, giving them the space and opportunity to excel, in a community of ambitious and talented peers. Letting the passion of exceptionally smart people drive innovation for our clients is the core concept of our organisation. Everything, from structure to values to strategic innovation to hiring to knowledge management is focused on this.  Being an authority in what we do is the lighthouse we are heading towards.
