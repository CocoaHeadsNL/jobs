Hi experienced Apple developer, we are Egeniq!
==============================================

Developing creative apps is in our blood. We are experts in making smart, innovative and progressive apps of the very best quality. With more than 38 specialists in-house, we work on achieving this every day.

### This is you

- You are an experienced software engineer (not a programmer).
- You like to share your knowledge and work as part of  a team.
- You always put the customer first.
- A techstack like Swift, MVVM, UIKit, SwiftUI, Cocoapods, Fastlane and MacOS is a piece of cake for you.

### This is what you’ll do at Egeniq

- You’ll make the difference with the apps you make at Egeniq.
- You’ll use your solution-oriented mindset every day.
- You’ll work where you feel most comfortable.
- You’ll work with the Gadget Kit: MacBook Pro, 27” 5k display and all of the devices you need for the apps you are going to make.

### This is what we expect from you

- We can ask you anything about iOS, WatchOS and tvOS.
- You are fluent in at least one programming language.
- You have completed a degree in IT or computer science and gained experience in a junior position or in a similar role.
- You are talented, passionate and persistently eager to learn—and you show it!

## This is Egeniq
Working at Egeniq means working in a pleasant atmosphere with people who share your passion. Teamwork is key for us, even though we work remotely. We see each other monthly in real life, but we also organise a conference with the entire company each year. And what about the annual summer and Christmas events? At Egeniq, efficient, flexible working and operating as part of a team in a creative setting go hand in hand.
