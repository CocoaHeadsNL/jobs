# Help us make amazing user experiences

We are looking for a full-time iOS Engineer to join our small team of passionate designers and developers.

## About us

If you're a frequent CocoaHeadsNL attendee, you might know us from three recent talks given by Touchwonders employees on Auto Layout, iBeacons and Animation Design. We have a passion for really understanding the platform that we build our apps for (including the complex bits of Auto Layout), we love new technologies so much that we built [an app](http://elevate.touchwonders.com/) just to get familiar with iBeacons, and we spend a lot of time on the look and feel of our apps, by prototyping animations and iterating on the implementation.

We make apps for a broad range of clients and end users. We built Weeronline HD, one of the most popular weather apps in the Netherlands. It has been used by over 600.000 people. We've also developed many apps that are used internally at clients such as ING, Rabobank and PON. These apps improve the way people do their jobs on a day to day basis.

Projects at Touchwonders are executed in small scrum teams that consist of up to three developers, a designer, tester and product owner. As a developer, you are responsible for estimating the duration of the work and your own planning and execution. You'll be able to have a meaningful influence on the end result from the start.

We like to share, learn and teach to get better as a team, so we made sure that there are plenty of opportunities at Touchwonders to do so. The development team has a weekly meeting in which we discuss recent developments in the field and showcase the cool things we're working on. There's also a monthly *dev session*, where we dive deeper into speficic topics, prepared by a member of the team.
