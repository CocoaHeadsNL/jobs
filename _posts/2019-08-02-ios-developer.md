Hi Apple developer, we are Egeniq
===================================

You know, we are actually quite disappointed that Apple does not make coffee machines yet. If this were the case, we would be the first one to create an iCoffeeOS-gadget. Does this mentality appeal to you? Then it is high time that we have a talk about it, as well as about all those other Apple OS-s.

At Egeniq you will work in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere with people who share your passion. With plenty of cool wearables and gadgets. Digital nomads co-operating as a team. Who wouldnâ€™t want that?

### This is you

* You are a software engineer and not a programmer. You understand why this is an important difference.
* You like to share your knowledge, and to learn from others.
* You make cool stuff that you are proud of.

### This is what you do at Egeniq

* With the apps you create at Egeniq, you make the difference.
* Each day you learn more.
* You work where you feel the most comfortable.
* You work with the Gadget Kit: MacBook Pro, Thunderbolt Display and all devices that you need for the apps you are going to make.

### What we expect from you

* If we have any questions about iOS, we can come to you.
* About at least one programming language, you know all ins and outs.
* You have completed a training in the field of IT or Computer Sciences.
* You are talented and passionate. Especially in and about programming. And you are not afraid of showing it.

DO YOU RECOGNIZE YOURSELF IN THIS POSITION?
