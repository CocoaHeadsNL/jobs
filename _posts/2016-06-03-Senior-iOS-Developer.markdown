#Company.
Capture International B.V. is an exciting and ambitious startup from Amsterdam that is developing a unique location-based photo sharing service for iOS and Android. The app lets users store their photos in the cloud and allows you to share them effortlessly with your nearby friends by tagging them in the photo. We're looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including cloud based services, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, device connectivity, mobile photography, location tracking, UI design and more. As a software engineer, you will have the opportunity to work on a highly visible, exciting and cool end-user product that is built for the masses. We need our engineers to be versatile, highly cooperative and be enthusiastic to tackle new problems across the stack as we continue to push technology forward. You will work in a small agile team of experts that consists of a Product manager/UX designer, Backend developer, Android developer and tester.

#You.
We are looking for a developer that can build high performance iOS apps. You have the knowledge to build social networking like apps that pull most of their content from the server and know when to do things locally or server side. You have demonstrable experience in creating and launching apps in Apple’s ecosystem (iTunesConnect, etc.). You're a smart and highly motivated engineer who posses the technical knowledge and insight to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks. You're fluent in Objective-C and Swift and know everything UIKit has to offer. You like building custom elements, have a sharp eye for detail and have no problem to interpret a good UI design into a well-aligned and scalable implementation. Any knowledge of mobile app development on other platforms is highly valuated. You apply best practices to ensure a secure system. You like to work in a dynamic environment and appreciate the freedom and responsibility of an entrepreneurial work style.

#Qualifications.
- Over 4 years professional experience as an iOS developer.
- You have launched at least one app into the AppStore
- Fluent in Objective-C and Swift and are following developments closely
- Additional frontend, backend, mobile- or web-development experiance is highly desirable (e.g. Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Java, Ruby).

 

#We Offer.
A fun working environment without the constant stress of a client’s deadline.

A high appreciation of quality code. The opportunity to focus on a recognizable end user product.

Plenty of room for creative input and ownership. Time to work on your own projects as long as you can present it to others.

The possibility to grow with a company and product from the start. The possibility to join our team as an entrepreneur.

A competitive salary plus share options for early employees.

An office ping pong table, a good lunch and the occasional after work drinks.

You can send us your CV but we are mostly interested to hear about your role in projects you are proud of. We also like to hear about any IT or GitHub projects you did outside of work.
