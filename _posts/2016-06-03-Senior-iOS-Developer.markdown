Capture International B.V. is an ambitious funded startup from Amsterdam that is developing a unique location-based camera sharing service for iOS and Android. At the moment there is a functional beta version for iOS that stores photos in the cloud shares it with other users nearby. The exiting moment has arrived to start building the first live version for the App Store. _Good read for Android developers should be that they will also start building for Google Play very soon._
